Charts
======

Charts is an iPad app for storing, displaying, and transposing guitar charts.

Version
-------
Charts is currently at **v0.3.0**. Until I hit 1.0.0, anything might change at any time. I'll do my best to keep things as stable and working as possible, but back up your music, friends!

Installation
------------
1. Navigate to http://dl.dropbox.com/u/76817/charts/index.html on an iPad.
2. Under the "Share" menu, tap "Add to Home Screen".
